description = r'''Given a sales system, if a salespersonâ€™s annual sales is greater than 2 million RMB and the number of 
days of leave is not more than 10 days, the cash receipt is greater than or equal to 60%, then the commission 
coefficient is 7, that is, the commission value is sales The amount is divided by the commission factor; the cash 
receipt is less than 60%, and the commission is not calculated. In all other cases and the cash arrival is less than or 
equal to 85%, the commission is calculated based on the commission factor of 6; the cash arrival is greater than 85% and 
the commission factor is treated as 5. Design a flow chart and design test cases according to the topic to achieve
